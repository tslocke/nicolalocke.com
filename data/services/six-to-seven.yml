  Africa, has an estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of 645,500 km2 which
  exceeds the values needed for a threatened category under criterion B.
  Although it has specific habitat requirements, which may mean that the area of
  occupancy (AOO) is more restricted, it occurs at many more than ten locations
  and it suspected not be subject to severe fragmentation, extreme fluctuations
  or major threats and continuing decline. The population is suspected to be
  large and relatively stable.
