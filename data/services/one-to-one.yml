  Confidence, motivation and self-awareness are imperative on the road to
  success, and we gain them by understanding ourselves, taking charge and being
  centred. No one is born with these skills, but everyone can discover them and
  the sooner, the better. Teen girls have a chance to find out who they really
  are gain the confidence, flexibility and motivation to succeed when they are
  still young. One to one coaching can help when Girls find it difficult to talk
  to a parent or carer.
