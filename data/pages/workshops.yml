  These group workshops for teen girls provides a safe, secure environment in
  which your daughter can rediscover her enjoyment of life.


  No lectures, just love and a compassionate patient atmosphere where she can
  share quality time and make friends.


  I wanted to do something to help girls build confidence, self -awareness and
  self-esteem. Most importantly, I believe they are suffering from
  disconnection; they are becoming more and more divided, cynical and
  competitive. I can see this is making them very troubled, so my passion was to
  open up group workshops around general happiness and wellbeing. With a plan to
  provide tools to help them cope. 


  In today's society, girls are increasingly anxious and critical about
  themselves and their friends. On a day to day basis, they are feeling
  hopeless.  They are lonely and insecure afraid to speak out in case of being
  ridiculed or judged. They are trying so hard to 'fit in' that they are going
  against their values. It is leaving them very unhappy and causing sadness,
  isolation and depression.


  I invite girls to join me on a journey of positive empowerment that will be
  motivational, through a real experience of group connection.  After being in
  this group, they will understand that they are not alone and will have a
  toolbox to carry with them throughout their life.


  During eight weeks, we will cover:


  * Keeping myself on track.

  * Self-evaluation. How I measure myself

  * The power of thoughts. Reversing the negative self-talk and making it
  positive

  * Understanding and coping with stress and anxiety.

  * Empathy and kindness

  * Better connections at home and with friends

  * Gratitude and why it matters

  * Healthy relationships

  * Navigating social media. Keeping safe online

  * Facing my fears.
