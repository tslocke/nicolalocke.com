  These group workshops for teen girls provide a safe, secure environment in
  which your daughter can rediscover her enjoyment of life.


  No lectures, just love and a compassionate patient atmosphere where she can
  share quality time and make friends.


  I wanted to do something to help girls build confidence, self-awareness and
  self-esteem. Most importantly, I believe they are suffering from
  disconnection; they are becoming more and more divided, cynical and
  competitive. I can see this is making them very troubled, so my passion was to
  open up group workshops around general happiness and wellbeing, with a plan to
  provide tools to help them cope. 


  In today's society, girls are increasingly anxious and critical about
  themselves and their friends. On a day to day basis, many are feeling
  hopeless, lonely and insecure, afraid to speak out in case of being ridiculed
  or judged. They are trying so hard to 'fit in' that they are going against
  their values. It is leaving them very unhappy and can lead to isolation and
  depression.


  I invite girls to join me on a journey of positive empowerment through a  real
  experience of group connection.  After being in this group, they will
  understand that they are not alone and will have a toolbox to carry with them
  throughout their life.


  During eight weeks, we will cover:


  * Keeping myself on track.

  * Self-evaluation. How I measure myself

  * The power of thoughts. Reversing the negative self-talk and making it
  positive

  * Understanding and coping with stress and anxiety.

  * Fixed mindset or, growth mindset

  * Staying calming, breathing exercises and meditation

  * The power of positive affirmations

  * Empathy and kindness

  * Better connections at home and with friends

  * Gratitude and why it matters

  * Healthy relationships

  * Navigating social media. Keeping safe online

  * Facing my fears.

  * Making goals and sticking to them.

  ## Parent Testimonals

  I can’t tell you how much my daughter has enjoyed Nicola’s workshops.
    
  She is a very shy child that finds social situations very difficult, so when I
  say that she didn’t miss one session and she was ready every Saturday waiting
  to go, it tells me a lot, it says she enjoyed being there and over the weeks
  she has learnt so much about herself. Nicola made her feel at ease and able to
  join in.
    
  I think this is a wonderful thing that Nicola is offering and would recommend
  it to anyone.

  My daughter was suffering from low self-esteem and was finding teenage friends
  difficult. This course really helped her. She learned how to think more
  positively, she made some new friends and she looked forward to it every
  week.  it's not that easy to get a teenager out of bed on a Saturday morning
  but this course really motivated her and Leamington is a lovely town to mooch
  around if you are a parent who doesn't live locally. 

  My daughter especially loved making her journal, her den and her mood board."


  Maddy says "Nicola is easy to talk to and really cares".
