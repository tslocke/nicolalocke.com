  Moving from Primary school to secondary school can often have a significant
  impact on our girl's lives. The first three years can be particularly
  challenging. It is usually a time of extreme stress. A time when girls are
  trying to find themselves, Work out who they are and how they will fit in. 


  To top of this, they are finding their way around new surroundings and coming
  to terms with a heavier workload.


  Girls are particularly sensitive to their looks, their bodies. They want to be
  seen as 'cool' and often want to be in the 'in' crowd. Being liked and getting
  'likes' is so vital to them. Their hormones are changing, which leads them to
  become over-reactive and often very emotional.


  Hanging on to old friends and making way for new ones can be a battleground
  for their self-esteem and self-confidence. It is a time when girls are
  maturing becoming much more independent and want to feel grown up and in
  control. But, for some, this can be a time when they feel disconnected, out of
  place, and very alone. It can be a time when girls will make unwanted choices
  so that they can feel a part of the crowd. It is a time of conflict which
  inevitably creates confusion.


  Starting in Jan 2020, I will run workshops for girls in year six. If you are
  interested in these workshops, please contact me regarding your interest. I
  will keep you informed with dates and times.
