  When girls are insecure and self-doubting, they look for ways of becoming
  noticed and likeable. With the added negative influence of social media, they
  often find themselves on a downward spiral that feels too overwhelming for
  them to sort out. At this crucial age, they do not turn to their parents. They
  are trying so hard to fit in with the crowd that they have also stopped
  turning to their friends. 


  Quite often, their perspective is blurred, taking them away from their primary
  goals and distorting their inner values and needs.


  In one - one, coaching girls have a chance to talk openly. Because it takes
  place online it creates a calm atmosphere. Where one gets to work at their own
  pace. Often enough, girls are carrying a burden that when shared and put into
  perspective can help motivate them back into a place of self-confidence. The
  coaching tools I use will enable them to take back control and help them to
  look at the bigger picture. 


  Unlike counselling, coaching is a lighter approach which looks at the here and
  now and offers creative ways of dealing with inner conflict and loss of
  confidence. I will share my skills and knowledge. A good coach aims to
  motivate and inspire. 


  I am providing life tools to help your daughter create coping skills and
  better self-awareness, which will give her a broader perspective on her
  journey into the adult world. having these tools in hand will help them make
  changes that may save them from a lifetime of regret.


  One-one coaching takes place on Skype. Please contact me regarding prices and
  sessions.
