  When girls are insecure and self-doubting, they look for ways of becoming
  noticed and likeable. With the added negative influence of social media, they
  often find themselves on a downward spiral that feels too overwhelming for
  them to sort out. At this crucial age, they do not turn to their parents. They
  are trying so hard to fit in with the crowd that they have also stopped
  turning to their friends. 


  Quite often, their perspective is blurred, taking them away from their primary
  goals and distorting their inner values and needs.


  In one to one coaching, girls have a chance to talk openly. Because it takes
  place online it creates a relaxed atmosphere. When girls are carrying a
  burdern what they need, is someone to help them put things into perspective.
  Someone who can help motivate them back into a place of self-confidence. The
  coaching tools I use will enable them to take back control and help them to
  look at the bigger picture. 


  Unlike counselling, coaching is a lighter approach which looks at the here and
  now and offers creative ways of dealing with inner conflict and loss of
  confidence. I will share my skills and knowledge. A good coach aims to
  motivate and inspire.
