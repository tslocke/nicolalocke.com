  When girls are insecure and self-doubting, they look for ways of becoming
  noticed and likeable. With the added negative influence of social media, they
  often find themselves on a downward spiral that feels too overwhelming for
  them to sort out. At this crucial age, they do not turn to their parents. They
  turn to their peers, who are not mature or knowledgable enough to help solve
  their problems. With lack of parental support they are left feeling vunarable.


  Quite often, their perspective is blurred, taking them away from their primary
  goals and distorting their inner values and needs.


  In one to one, girls have a chance to talk openly and privately. When girls
  are carrying a burdern what they need, is someone to help them put things into
  perspective. Someone who can help motivate them back into a place of
  self-confidence. The tools I use will enable them to take back control and
