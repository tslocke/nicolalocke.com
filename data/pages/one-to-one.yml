  When girls are insecure and self-doubting, they look for ways of becoming
  noticed and likeable. With the negative influence of social media, they often
  find themselves on a downward spiral that feels too overwhelming for them to
  sort out. At this crucial age, they do not turn to their parents. They are
  trying so hard to fit in with the crowd that they have also stopped turning to
  their friends. 




  Quite often, their perspective is blurred, taking them away from their primary
  goals and distorting their inner values and needs.




  In one - one, coaching girls have a chance to talk openly. When the load is
  shared, it can give relief. Often enough, girls are carrying a burden that
  when shared and put into perspective can help motivate them back into a place
  of self-confidence. The coaching tools I use will enable them to take back
  control and help them to look at the bigger picture. 




  Unlike counselling, coaching is a lighter approach which looks at the here and
  now and offers creative ways of dealing with inner conflict. A good coach aims
  to motivate and inspire. 




  I will share my skills and knowledge. I am providing life tools to help your
  daughter create coping skills and self-awareness, which will give her a
  broader perspective on her journey into the adult world.  It's incredible how
  they can easily adjust and make changes that may save them from a lifetime of
  regret.




  Coaching can take place in person or on Skype. Please contact me regarding
  prices and sessions.
