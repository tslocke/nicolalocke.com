  # Hi there!


  ## My name is Nicola.


  A very warm welcome to my website


  I am a creative and idealistic youth and child coach for teen girls.


  I am dedicated to my craft with over thirty years of experience working with
  children and teenagers. I am passionate about the wellbeing of our youth. I
  have devoted my working life to support and inspire young people. I have also
  been very fortunate to have had the possibility to explore many forms of art
  and crafts. I have used methods such as creative and intuitive collaging and
  journaling. I am a qualified cognitive behavioural therapist. I work with
  clients  one-one and in groups. I also work online. 


  I am helping girls to find tools that will prevent them from making mistakes â€”
  teaching them new ways to deal with stressful situations. Teaching them to
  become more in touch with their emotions. Most of all, showing them that they
  are not alone. 


  I believe, there is an awareness that they are not paying attention to, and
  this seems to be causing them to follow the crowd. I wanted to point out that
  there are many ways of saying no, staying focused, taking control and not
  losing sight of the bigger picture. The recent workshops that have taken place
  this spring have been evidence to not only the success but, the need for more.
  I have a deep concern for girls, and this drives me forward. I am honoured to
  work with them and feel completely in awe of their ability to adapt and make
  adjustments. Even the smallest change can make a huge difference.
