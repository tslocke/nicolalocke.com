  # Hi there!


  ## My name is Nicola.


  A very warm welcome to my website


  I am a creative and idealistic youth coach for teen girls.


  I believe that most girls are not living their best life. Because, they dont
  know how to make changes that will free them from trying to be like everyone
  else or, caring to much about what others think. Because they often cut their
  ties to parents, they turn to peers who are immature and, not able to give the
  support that is needed.


  I am dedicated to my craft with over thirty years of experience working with
  children and teenagers. I am passionate about the wellbeing of young girls. I
  have devoted my working life to support and inspire young people. I have also
  been very fortunate to have had the possibility to explore many forms of art
  and crafts. I have used methods such as creative and intuitive collaging and
  journaling. I am a qualified cognitive behavioural therapist. I work with
  clients  one-one and in groups. 


  I am helping girls to find tools that will prevent them from making mistakes â€”
  teaching them new ways to deal with stressful situations. Teaching them to
  become more in touch with their emotions. Most of all, showing them that they
  are not alone. 


  I believe, there is an awareness that they are not paying attention to, and
  this seems to be causing them to follow the crowd. I teach girls how to say
  no, stay focused, take control and how to not lose sight of the bigger
  picture. The recent workshops that have taken place this spring have been
  evidence to not only the success but, the need for many more. I have a deep
  concern for girls, and this drives me forward. I am honoured to work with them
  and feel completely in awe of their ability to adapt and make adjustments.
  Even the smallest change can make a huge difference. 


  I hope my website inspires you. Please dont hesitate to contact me with any
  questions. <mailto:nicola@nicolalocke.com>
