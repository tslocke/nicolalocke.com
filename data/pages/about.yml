  # Hi there!
  
  ## My name is Nicola.

  A very warm welcome to my website

  I have had the greatest honour of working with children and parents on and off for more than 30 years. I have also been very fortunate to have had the possibility to explore many forms of art and crafts. I have used methods such as creative and intuitive collaging and journaling. I have spent many years mentoring, supporting and listening to people's stories. I have a belief that depression and anxiety are a problem often caused by the lifestyle we choose.  With the influence of smartphones and social media, I believe that this problem is becoming an epidemic.

  With all this training at hand, my goal was to create a way to help people, especially young girls tackle the difficulties that they are struggling with. 

  A lot of my work has been with the younger generation. I am most inspired by working with early prevention. I started at 16 years old mentoring young girls in my local youth club. 

  Through creative media, I have found beautiful incentives that have become very much a part of my work. My concern for the younger generation keeps me very much involved with youth work and School projects.

  The workshops that I run to inspire girls to take control of their lives are becoming very popular.
