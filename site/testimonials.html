              I wanted to thank you for the wonderful Empowerment Course Amelia attended. Before she started, Amelia was transitioning into secondary school and her anxiety levels had reached such a pitch, I didn’t quite know what to do with her. Then I saw your courses advertised and from the description, I thought it must be worth giving it a go.
            </p>
            <p>
              Amelia was so skeptical and not looking forward to it, that I thought it would be a bonus if she just attends the first one. However, I couldn’t believe her reaction when I picked her up, she enjoyed it so much and couldn’t wait to return the next week. You offer such a calm, relaxing atmosphere and you have such a reassuring manor, the girls immediately feel at ease. The activities are great and the group sizes are perfect so they do not feel intimidated.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this world of social media and perceptions of how they should be, it is so lovely for like minded girls to come together and realise that they are not alone. Amelia always used to rave about your snack selection too!! And thank you so much for their lovely gift, Amelia was thrilled with this and has it pride of place in her room, together with her mood board. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It was the best money I have ever spent on Amelia and very reasonable for what you include. If there was ever a follow on course, we would jump at the chance, as she was so sad when it was over. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Having said that, the fact that you have set up this You Tube channel for the girls during this time of Corona is brilliant, Amelia has been adding to her journal too. So thank you for everything you have done for Amelia, the way she can now calm herself down in a situation is brilliant and it really helped with her outlook on friendships.

            My 12 year-old daughter thoroughly enjoyed the 8-week course. I signed her up for it to help her learn some coping skills, tips and techniques, anything which would help her navigate the early months of secondary school. She loved it and was very keen to bring along her journal every week. I had the utmost trust in Nicola: she is a lovely woman and the sessions had a very warm and caring feel to them - definitely a very safe space for the girls. I wish I had found this course sooner. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it.

              My daughter has been going to Nicola’s group for nearly 5 weeks. The first week she started she was very clingy and upset about meeting new people. By the time anxious mommy went Back two hours later, I peeped through the door to my daughter so happy and content, it brought tears too my eyes. My daughter has had a rough few months with a lot to deal with and finds making and keeping friends hard. She has dealt with bullying and low self esteem , has no confidence and hates the way she looks. Being at this group, I have seen my daughter coming back to her old self. She has a bit more confidence, still a long way to go but, such an amazing group. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Nicola sets the girls up with tools to cope. Each week different challenges, it’s amazing. I never thought I would see my daughter look forward to anything again but, she loves her Saturday morning meets and will definitely be attending again if Nicola sets up a meet for them.  Thanks again for all your help so far and your constant support through emails etc. I would highly recommend

              Seeing my daughter struggle with anxiety and negative thoughts has been tough.  Not to mention drying the tears caused by friends and social media...
            </p>
            <p>
              But what a difference a few weeks meeting with Nicola has made!  She is up and eager to get to group on a Saturday morning.  She enjoys working on her journal, and is always adding little bits to it.  She is starting to understand how important caring for herself and being herself is.  When the tough moments hit, she handles it much more positively, using the methods learned.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Nicola gives the girls a relaxed and safe environment to be themselves while giving them tools to become strong, confident and happy young women.  I would highly recommend her empowerment course for any young lady struggling with the stress of being a teenager.
