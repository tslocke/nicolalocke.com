            <p>
              Structured one to one sessions are helpful for girls who need more individual attention, giving them the space and time to talk through their thoughts and feelings in a safe and supportive environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              During this time it is important that we establish trust. We will work on your childs individual issues. These will be self guided.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may use creative tools such as journaling as a way to explore ones needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              A course of 6 to 8 weeks is usually recommended. The sessions will last one hour.
            </p>

              If it is discovered that your daughter is facing more serious challenges, it may be helpful to refer her on to a more specialised therapist. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Please contact me to set up an initial, free, consultation to assess your child’s needs at nicola@nicolalocke.com or telephone 07886 404098. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The cost of one to one will be charged at £35.00ph and can be paid in cash or by bank transfer.
