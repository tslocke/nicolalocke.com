              I am a creative and inspirational youth mentor with over thirty years experience working with children and teens. Most recently my focus has been on developing workshops for tween and teen girls as I’ve seen how they are increasingly facing problems they’re unable to solve by themselves. Girls are getting trapped in a competitive world which is causing them to become more isolated and unhappy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, instead of taking advice from parents or other adults, girls often turn to peers who are not mature or knowledgeable enough to provide the right kind of support. For this and other reasons they are failing to develop into the healthy and confident young women they should be.
            </p>
            <p>
              In these workshops we establish a positive and accepting environment where everyone can relax and truly be themselves. We use creative journaling, guided discussion, vision boards, self-evaluation, calming and breathing techniques, collage and other tools that strengthen their self-awareness, emotional intelligence, confidence and assertiveness. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Girls learn how to stay focused, take control and how to not lose sight of potential long term consequences of their behaviours. We also focus on diminishing negative thinking patterns that lead to stress, anxiety and a need to conform to peer pressure and the demands of our modern society.
            </p>
            <p>
              I work with clients on a one to one basis or in small groups. I will happily adjust myself to the needs of my client. Please feel free to contact me with any concerns or questions.
