              Young girls need mentors because they need someone who can help them navigate through difficult times. Someone who’ll look them in the eye, someone authentic, kind and supportive. Someone who will listen, and validate whatever it is they are going through. At a time when these young minds are trying to figure it all out, just one person from outside the family is enough for them to start believing in themselves again. Sometimes that person needs to be a trusted mentor.

              Welcome to my website, I am a creative and inspirational youth mentor and workshop facilitator for young girls enduring peer pressure, cyberbullying and other anxieties. with over thirty years experience working with children and teens. I have focused my attention on developing workshops for young girls. In 2019 I founded self empowerment workshops to help girls navigate the uncertainties and difficulties they face. The workshops and one to one sessions I deliver lead directly to improved mental and emotional well being.( see testimonials) In 2020 I self published a book “My Life My Happiness” This book is a 16 week self care journal that aims to improve the well being of young girls.

              I believe, “you have to put the power back into the hands of the young person, and teach them how to manage their own self care.” I am deeply concerned about the lack of support young girls are getting. With schools over run with young people in crisis, the need is demanding.Girls are slipping through the net. They are taking to social media and looking up all kinds of things that are potentially harmful. They spend time looking at images of other girls which makes them feel insecure and inadequate. With the digital world moving at a fast pace it is hard for parents and schools to keep up. Girls are becoming more and more anxious. As the peer pressure escalates and negative banter increases, it is becoming almost impossible for young girls to stand up for themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my work I show girls how to stand back and reflect, I teach them how to look beyond social media and peer group pressure. I educate them to think ahead and look at the bigger picture,. Most importantly I give them the tools to take back control, and believe in themselves.

              Some girls find it hard to talk to their parents. In this modern world they often turn away from parents and put all of their trust in friends. Often these friends can miss guide them. If you see signs that your daughter is struggling don’t wait, get help for her soon. You need to prevent her from turning to her young friends or the internet to find the answers. A lot of which is distorted and not always helpful.
